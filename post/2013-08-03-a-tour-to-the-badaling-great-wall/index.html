          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Today, I went to the Badaling Great Wall <strong>alone</strong>.</p>

<p>There is a saying that <strong>He who has never been to the Great Wall is not a</strong>
<strong>true man</strong>.</p>

<p>I had read this saying for many times when I was in high school, but I have
never been to the Great Wall util today.</p>

<p>I got up at 7:00am and began my tour at about 7:40am after the breakfast.
It took me 30 minutes to arrive at <em>Xi zhi men station</em> from where I live.</p>

    <figcaption>
        <h4>Too many people</h4>
        
    </figcaption>

<p>I planed to take the <em>Shi jiao yan qing s2 line</em> train to the Great Wall
directly at <em>Beijing bei station</em>, which is near the <em>Xi zhi men station</em>.
However, when I arrived there, the staff of the station said that the train
will depart at 11:00am.I watched my smart phone, which showed that it&rsquo;s
8:24am now.So I had to wait for about 2.5 hours if I took this train.Because
I&rsquo;am those one who don&rsquo;t want to stay in a place too long and want to go
somewhere to have a look, I prefer the other type of a tour.Therefore, from
the staff of the train, I knew that I could take buses to the Great Wall.</p>

<p>Thanks to the <em>Baidu Map</em>, this time I need to take the <em>line 13 train</em> and
arrive at the <em>Long ze station</em>, then take the <em>878 bus</em>.However, when I
arrived at the <em>Long ze station</em> and the <em>878 bus station</em>, I found something
almost shock me.That is, the <em>878 bus</em> only depart at 7:00am-9:00am.But my
smart phone showed that it&rsquo;s 9:03am.Oh my god!But I didn&rsquo;t give up.I stayed
there for another 20 minutes.This time, I almost wanted to go back home because
I looked for 10 minutes to find some bus that can go to the Great Wall and I
failed.</p>

<p>I was still stubborn so that I found another way to go to the Great Wall from
<em>Baidu Map</em>.This time I went back to the <em>Xi er qi station</em>, take the
<em>Chang ping line train</em> and arrived at the final station <em>Nan shao station</em>.
When I got out of the station, I was shock again.This place is a remote village
and I can&rsquo;t find a bus after looking for 10 minutes.So I went back to the
exit of the subway and ask a driver of the <em>black car</em> how much of taking me
to the Badaling Great Wall.His answer suprised me because he wanted 180 yuan.
Although I could bargin with him to reduce the price to 100 yuan, but it&rsquo;s
still very very very expensive.This time I wanted to give up and went away to
find another bus station.When I got there, I found it&rsquo;s excactly the bus I
could take to the Great Wall.This is the <em>870 bus</em> and then the bus didn&rsquo;t
appear.Fortunately, the bus was coming soon and I got in without thinking.
That is, <strong>there is a way out for somebody</strong>.</p>

<p>After about an hour, I arrived at <em>Ni sha he station</em> and I need to change to
another bus.This time, I could take <em>919 bus</em> or the <em>879</em> bus and I felt the
Great Wall was near.After about 5 minutes, the bus comed but there were too
many people there, so I had to stand in the bus.I thought the bus will arrived
at the Great Wall no more than 20 minutes, but I never wanted to know that it&rsquo;s
the most painful bus I have ever taken.I standed in the bus for more than 1.5
hours because of the traffic jam!</p>

<p>Finally I arrived at the Great Wall.</p>

<p>First, I have a lunch at <em>Yong he da wang restaurant</em>.</p>

<p>There were lots of people.But I thought there will be more in Spring and Autumn.
The photo below shows the <em>North Wall</em>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s obvious that I was on the south wall, and the photo below is a bird&rsquo;s-eye
view of the north wall.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that I must have someone take a photo for myself.The photo
below is it, I&rsquo;m not very handsome as you imaged, though.</p>

<p>The return tour was so relax because I could take the <em>877 bus</em> to
<em>De sheng men xi station</em> directly!And it const me only 4.8 yuan.</p>

<p>In a word, although <em>the Badaling Great Wall</em> is not so <strong>great</strong> as
<em>the Palace</em>, I was still very happy today, because it&rsquo;s the first time I have
a tour <strong>alone</strong>.</p>
