+++

Today, I went to the Badaling Great Wall **alone**.

There is a saying that **He who has never been to the Great Wall is not a**
**true man**.

I had read this saying for many times when I was in high school, but I have
never been to the Great Wall util today.

I got up at 7:00am and began my tour at about 7:40am after the breakfast.
It took me 30 minutes to arrive at *Xi zhi men station* from where I live.

I planed to take the *Shi jiao yan qing s2 line* train to the Great Wall
directly at *Beijing bei station*, which is near the *Xi zhi men station*.
However, when I arrived there, the staff of the station said that the train
will depart at 11:00am.I watched my smart phone, which showed that it's
8:24am now.So I had to wait for about 2.5 hours if I took this train.Because
I'am those one who don't want to stay in a place too long and want to go
somewhere to have a look, I prefer the other type of a tour.Therefore, from
the staff of the train, I knew that I could take buses to the Great Wall.

Thanks to the *Baidu Map*, this time I need to take the *line 13 train* and
arrive at the *Long ze station*, then take the *878 bus*.However, when I
arrived at the *Long ze station* and the *878 bus station*, I found something
almost shock me.That is, the *878 bus* only depart at 7:00am-9:00am.But my
smart phone showed that it's 9:03am.Oh my god!But I didn't give up.I stayed
there for another 20 minutes.This time, I almost wanted to go back home because
I looked for 10 minutes to find some bus that can go to the Great Wall and I
failed.

I was still stubborn so that I found another way to go to the Great Wall from
*Baidu Map*.This time I went back to the *Xi er qi station*, take the
*Chang ping line train* and arrived at the final station *Nan shao station*.
When I got out of the station, I was shock again.This place is a remote village
and I can't find a bus after looking for 10 minutes.So I went back to the
exit of the subway and ask a driver of the *black car* how much of taking me
to the Badaling Great Wall.His answer suprised me because he wanted 180 yuan.
Although I could bargin with him to reduce the price to 100 yuan, but it's
still very very very expensive.This time I wanted to give up and went away to
find another bus station.When I got there, I found it's excactly the bus I
could take to the Great Wall.This is the *870 bus* and then the bus didn't
appear.Fortunately, the bus was coming soon and I got in without thinking.
That is, **there is a way out for somebody**.

After about an hour, I arrived at *Ni sha he station* and I need to change to
another bus.This time, I could take *919 bus* or the *879* bus and I felt the
Great Wall was near.After about 5 minutes, the bus comed but there were too
many people there, so I had to stand in the bus.I thought the bus will arrived
at the Great Wall no more than 20 minutes, but I never wanted to know that it's
the most painful bus I have ever taken.I standed in the bus for more than 1.5
hours because of the traffic jam!

Finally I arrived at the Great Wall.

First, I have a lunch at *Yong he da wang restaurant*.

There were lots of people.But I thought there will be more in Spring and Autumn.
The photo below shows the *North Wall*.

It's obvious that I was on the south wall, and the photo below is a bird's-eye
view of the north wall.

There is no doubt that I must have someone take a photo for myself.The photo
below is it, I'm not very handsome as you imaged, though.

The return tour was so relax because I could take the *877 bus* to
*De sheng men xi station* directly!And it const me only 4.8 yuan.

In a word, although *the Badaling Great Wall* is not so **great** as
*the Palace*, I was still very happy today, because it's the first time I have
a tour **alone**.
